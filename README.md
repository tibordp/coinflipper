Coin Flipper
============

The latest in coin-flipping technology, this program will flip any desired amount of coins at once, using a random generator of your most refined choice.

The purpose of the project is to benchmark and verify uniformnmess of random number generators, while providing an easy-to-use server-client model, allowing you to flip coins using thousands of CPU-saturated nodes at once. Fun for whole family!

It does so by counting occurences of coin flip streaks of any length (between 1 and 128). The client nodes generate coin flips and send their statistics to the server.

Building
--------

Requires an implementation of Google's Protocol Buffers compiler (protobuf), ZeroMQ, GNU Make, a C++11-able C++ compiler (e.g. GCC >=4.9.0, Clang), and a sensible build environment (i.e. not Windows).

Run `make protobuf`, then `make`. It's that easy!

Usage
-----

Coin Flipper utilises a server-client model, so both your server and your client(s) must have it compiled, and have network connectivity between each other.
What you should first set up is the server. Run `./coinflipper server` on the desired server machine.
The next thing you want to do is run `./coinflipper flipper <server address>` on each of the client nodes you wish to configure (the more the merrier!).
You can spectate the accumulated statistics on the server by running `./coinflipper status <server address>` from any machine that has network connectivity to the server.
That's it! You're done! Enjoy your coin flips!
